# sim2D
My first attempt at building a flight simulator.

To compile from a terminal:
$ javac sim2D/*.java

To run from a terminal:
$ java sim2D/simOpen

The simulator has been designed to fly on autopilot. However, it can be 'hand' flown with the keys listed here.

Pitch up: down arrow key (gentle), or 2 on keypad (larger elevator movement)
Pitch down: up arrow key (gentle), or 8 on keypad (larger elevator movement)

Roll left: left arrow key (gentle), or 4 on keypad (larger aileron movement)
Roll right: right arrow key (gentle), or 6 on keypad (larger aileron movement)

Rudder left: 1 on keypad
Rudder right: 3 on keypad
Note: Due to the design of the simulator, rudder is not really required to turn here.

Increase thrust: PageUp
Decrease thrust: PageDown

Use the mouse to select heading, altitude, attitude (if desired), raise and lower the undercarriage (important for landing!), arming the ILS localizer (LLZ) and ILS glideslope (GS). Click on the yellow numbers to select heading, altitude and attitude.

PFD = Primary Flight Display
AP = Autopilot
VV = Velocity Vector (green circle on PFD)
FD = Flight Director (pink bars on PFD)
ND = Navigation Display
